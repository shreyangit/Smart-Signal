# Smart-Signal
Smart Signal is an openCV project integrated with IoT, in this case RaspberryPi4. 

Project Topic:
 Development of an intelligent pedestrian crossing system utilizing computer vision to enhance safety at road crossings.

Objective: 
To detect pedestrians and their intentions (e.g., raising hands) in real-time using a Raspberry Pi 4 and YOLOv8 model, activating red LED lights to signal vehicles to stop.
Test the system in various conditions to refine detection accuracy and responsiveness.

Expected Results:
A reliable and responsive system that automatically activates red lights upon detecting pedestrians or hand signals.

FURTHER:
Red Light will turn on whenever a person is detected on the zebra-crossing.
Red Light will also turn on whenever a person, even when not on the road, but on the edge, raises hand, signaling the car to stop.
Power Supply is provided to Raspberry Pi from adapter.

The Red LEDs light up as intended. A box was drawn on zebra-crossing. The Yolo model lights up Red Light whenever a person is detected inside the box drawn.
Two boxes are drawn adjacent to the zebra-crossing. Whenever a person raises their hand, pose detection function lights up the red light.

CONCLUSION:
 
This project demonstrates an ML-based pedestrian crossing system using computer vision to detect pedestrians and interpret hand gestures as crossing intent. By combining YOLOv8â€™s pose detection on a Raspberry Pi, the system can activate red LED signals to alert vehicles when pedestrians are detected on a crossing or are preparing to cross. This setup provides a  scalable solution for enhancing pedestrian safety in various urban settings.
